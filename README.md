# Trash Vampires

Website for my band, Trash Vampires. Check it out at https://trashvampires.com.

## How was it made?

The main framework is SvelteKit. I'm hosting on Vercel. While I go through iterations on the design itself, currently it's made with [Threlte](https://github.com/threlte/threlte), which is a Three.js library for Svelte.
